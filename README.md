# Net Promoter Scores Analysis
- Skill Assessment Excersices using SQL and Python.

## Table of contents
1. Resources folder with CSV data files (nps dataset, tickets data set & ids dataset)
2. SQL queries file (done with PostgreSQL database)
3. NLP Analysis using Python and PySpark (Google Collab notebook)

## Summary
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis, and NLP Analysis on Net Promoter Scores (NPS scores) from a company that uses the data as key business metric for student satisfaction and program decisions.

## Sections
1. Exercise A (EDA process using SQL): students are provided support tools designed to provide rapid assistance to questions regarding curriculum topics or course assignments. Students submit questions to our support ticketing system, and their questions are routed to their dedicated Success Manager.
2. Exercise B (NLP sentiment analysis using Python)
- Part 1: uses the Net Promoter Score (NPS) as a key business metric to measure overall student satisfaction at the conclusion of every course. Surveys are sent to students to collect the Overall Course, Instructor, and Student Support Score, as well as any comments on ways we can improve the course, instruction, and supportive services. Individual NPS scores range from 0 to 10. An NPS score above 8 is a Promoter (e.g. student would highly recommend the course to others), and an NPS score less than 7 is a Detractor (e.g. not likely to recommend).
- Part 2: Using the same file, run an NLP text analysis on the improvement field to see what categories of words appear more frequently and if polarity score accurately matches sentiment.
